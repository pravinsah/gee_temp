# gee_temp
It has been developed in Angular 6 

Currently it is using Array Object to list the data.

Project Setup / Installation Steps :
1. install nodeJs 8+ 
2. install angular : npm install -g @angular/cli@latest  
3. Creat new project : ng new gee-temp-app   get inside this folder 
I have used bootstrap3 for desiging templates, please install
4. npm install -save bootstrap@3
5. replace src folder available at : https://github.com/pravinsah/gee_temp/tree/master/gee-temp-app/src 
6. replace "angular.json" - changes made to used bootstrap css

## Question
1. If you had more time, how you would have improved the project?
- Temperature Listing can be split into single component and data can be @Input into this.
- Currently I have kept data type as any[] in most case, this need to be modified to proper object.
 

2. If you had the choice, what would be your ideal development environment? (IDE' stack, technology, etc.)
Currently I am using Visual Studio and happy to use the same.
